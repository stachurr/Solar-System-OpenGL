# Scale
The following is a list of properties that have been kept to-scale. You will notice that "Distance from Sun" is not on this list. This is because the distances are so large, the size of the planets would be less than a pixel if scaled properly.
  - Sizes (toggleable) ...exluding the sun
  - Orbital Periods
  - Axial Tilts
  - Rotation Periods
